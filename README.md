# Ngcalculator

A simple calculator made in Angular. It calculates values based on the buttons you press. Currently only division, addition, subtraction and multiplication are supported. 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.2.

## Development server

You will need node and [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) to build and run this project. 
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

I aimed at building the logic test-driven. 
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
